# Pandemic

- **Play time**: 5 minute set up + 10 minute gameplay
- **Players**: 4-12
- **Required**: 1 NFC chip per person

**Pandemic** is a social deduction game.

## Roles

- **Doctors** want to collect as many vaccines as possible. Doctors don't know what role other people are. A doctor wins if they have at least 3 vaccines at the end of the game.
- **Imposters** want to infect as many people as possible. Imposters know who the other imposters are. An imposter wins if at least half the group rounded down is infected at the end of the game.

## Actions

Players take turns in clockwise order performing 1 of 3 actions:

### Read chip

Check your status (vaccine count and infection status).

### Contact

Contact another player.

- Normal + Normal =
  Each player receives 1 vaccine. However, connecting with the same person twice will not produce another vaccine.
- Infected + Infected =
  Nothing happens.
- Normal + Infected =
  If the normal player has at least 1 vaccine, the infected player becomes cured and a vaccine is spent. Otherwise, the normal player becomes infected.

### Activate vaccine

Spend a vaccine to cure your infection. A vaccine is spent regardless of whether you were infected.
