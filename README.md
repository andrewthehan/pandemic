# Pandemic

- **Setup time**: 5 minutes
- **Gameplay length**: 1 round per player
- **Players**: 4+
- **Required**: 1 NFC chip per person

**Pandemic** is a social deduction game.

## Roles

- **Doctors** want to collect as many vaccines as possible. Doctors don't know what role other people are. A doctor wins if they are not infected and have at least 3 vaccines at the end of the game.
- **Anti-vaxxers** want to infect as many people as possible. Anti-vaxxers know who the other anti-vaxxers are. An anti-vaxxer wins if at least half the group rounded down is infected at the end of the game.

## Actions

For each round, players take turns in <b>clockwise</b> order performing 1 of 3 actions. At the end of each round, the number of infected players is revealed.

### Read chip

Check your status (vaccine count and infection status).

### Contact

Contact another player. The receiving player may not reject contact.

- Normal + Normal =
  Each player receives 1 vaccine. However, connecting with the same person twice will not produce another vaccine.
- Infected + Infected =
  Nothing happens. Even if the infected players have vaccines, players can only cure others if they are normal themselves.
- Normal + Infected =
  If the normal player has at least 1 vaccine, the infected player becomes cured and a vaccine is spent. Otherwise, the normal player becomes infected.

### Activate vaccine

Spend a vaccine to cure your infection. A vaccine is spent regardless of whether you were infected.
